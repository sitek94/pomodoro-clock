# Pomodoro Clock

See the project live: https://sitek94.github.io/pomodoro-clock/

The aim of the app is to help you stay productive by using [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).

Pomodoro Clock functionality is based on `user stories` by freeCodeCamp:
[Build a Pomodoro Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock)

## Motivation

While building the app my goal was to practice following concepts/technologies:
* React, React Hooks
  * useEffect to setInterval
  * useRef to play the audio 
* Material UI framework
* CSS Grid
